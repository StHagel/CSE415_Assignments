\subsection*{Question 1a:}\label{sec:1a}

It took 4 iterations to turn 9 of the 27 states green.

\subsection*{Question 1b:}\label{sec:1b}

It took 8 total iterations to turn all 27 steps green.
Running a 9th iteration does not change the values anymore.

\subsection*{Question 1c:}\label{sec:1c}

The policy shown suggests to "go right" in every single state.
This happens, because every state has a value of 100.0 and therefore the algorithm gives each state the same value as the goal.
Therefore it doesn't bother to go to the goal, since the values are the same.
%The policy shown results in finding the quickest path from each state, since the value of the states only updates one move at a time.
%My implementation of the problem actually fails to show the correct policy, if the problem is deterministic, as the assignment wants, and states get reiterated.
%Doing more iterations on states, that have already been done sets the policy to "go right" everytime.
%If the program is run with 20\% noise though, it works just as fine and still gives the right policy.
