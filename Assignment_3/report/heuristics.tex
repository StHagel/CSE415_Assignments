\section{Heuristics for the Eight Puzzle} \label{sec:heuristics8}

For the sake of fitting the table onto one page, I will not include the initial configuration of each of the puzzles
inside of the table, but I will rather give them outside, as the report template suggests.
Since none of the problems took longer than five minutes with either heuristic, I did not need to abort any of them.
Therefore, I won't include this in the table either.
The Table contains another column though, called "Time".
The value for "Time" is based on the time it took for the algorithm to solve the problem on my Laptop with an Intel
Core i5-560M processor (3\;M cache, 2.66\;GHz) and 3.75\;GB of RAM .
