approach = '''We will work with a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube to significantly reduce the size of the state space.
              We will use Q-Learning and deep learning to solve the puzzle. Furthermore, we use the method of
              curriculum learning, which iteratively gives the algorithm states, which need more moves to be solved.
              Our goal is to bring the algorithm as close to solving the cube optimally, that is in 11 or less moves
              (11 is the so called "God\'s number" for the 2x2x2 cube).'''

                           Both will work closely together to use deep learning methods to improve the algorithm.'''
